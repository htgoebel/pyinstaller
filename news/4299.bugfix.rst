Fix loading of plugin-type modules at run-time of the frozen application:
If the plugin path is one character longer than sys._MEIPATH
(e.g. "$PWD/p/plugin_1" and "$PWD/dist/main"),
the plugin relative-imports a sub-module (of the plugin)
and the frozen application contains a module of the same name,
the frozen application module was imported.
